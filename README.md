# Handwritten Digits Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Implemented a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project involved preprocessing the MNIST dataset, feature scaling and training the KNN model to accurately identify digits. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 97%, successfully recognizing handwritten digits with high precision. The project demonstrated the efficacy of KNN for image recognition tasks, providing a foundation for more complex computer vision applications.
