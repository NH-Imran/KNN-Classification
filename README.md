# Handwritten Digits Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
▯ Objective: Developed a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
▯ Tools and Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks
▯ Key Activities:
 □ Data Preprocessing: 
 1. Loaded and normalized the MNIST dataset to scale pixel values between 0 and 
 1 for consistent model performance.
 2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
 □ Model Development:
 1. Implemented the KNN algorithm using Scikit-learn, experimenting with different values of k to 
 optimize model accuracy.
 2. Used cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
 □ Model Evaluation:
 1 Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 2. Visualized the confusion matrix to understand classification errors and improve model tuning.
 □ Optimization: Compared KNN with other algorithms like SVM and Random Forest to validate its 
 effectiveness for this classification task.
▯ Outcomes: Achieved a classification accuracy of 97%, successfully recognizing handwritten digits with high precision. The project demonstrated the efficacy of KNN for image recognition tasks, providing a foundation for more complex computer vision applications.
